# Excel_Coffee_Sales_Dashboard

I have developed dashboard to find KPI insights regarding Total sales over time, sales by various countires, top customers etc

In initial data analysis steps, I have used many functions like VLookup, INDEX Match, IF etc. To clean and analys data, I have checked and removed duplicates.

To build relation with data, I have build pivot tables and pivot charts.

While building dashboard, I have inserted Timeline and Slicers filter the data according to need. Also added charts to improve visulization part.
